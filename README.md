# Angular
I have decided to develop the app, where user has an opportunity to sign up  and add posts

## How to run the app
In the terminal :
* `npm install`<br/>
Write your mysql connection config in the file, located in `main_server/server_mod/tasks/mysql_jobs/connection.ts`. After it, just type in the terminal:
* `npm run start`
